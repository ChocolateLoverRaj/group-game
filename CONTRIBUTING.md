## Developing / Building

### Web
Install dependencies in `web` folder. Then you can run `npm start` and open the localhost link in your browser. You can run `npm run build` to generate the static assets.

### Windows
Install dependencies in the `electron` folder. Then run `npm start`. A window will open. For viewing changes in the `main.js` file, you'll have to restart the `npm start` command / close the window and start it again. You can run `npm run make` to make the zip folder.
